# physical-modelling-synth-in-bela
The Aim of this project is to create a real-time playable physical modelling synthesizer with two
models (i) Extended Karplus-Strong model (ii) Digital waveguide jet-woodwind model playable
through a midi controller. A video containing the demonstration of this project is available at
https://youtu.be/LWot4nR_Q_o

Checkout the documentation for detailed information on the implementation at: https://github.com/clffrd/physical-modelling-synth-in-bela/blob/main/ECS_7012P_Final_Individual_Project_Report.pdf 
This program is written in c++ and is designed to run on the bela platform

This project was done as part of my coursework for my masters in sound and music computing at queen mary university of london
